Step into the shoes of a person under interrogation by a mysterious AI. In this mind-bending game, you will be asked a series of thought-provoking questions designed to challenge your understanding of humanity, emotions, and existence. Each answer you provide will influence the AI's perception of you, leading to unexpected responses and ultimately determining your fate.

The game is an exploration of identity, self-awareness, and the fine line between human and machine. As you progress through the game, your answers will affect the AI’s reactions, pushing you closer to one of two possible endings: a chilling revelation that you may not be human, or a darker, more irreversible conclusion that you are, in fact, dead inside.

With over 30 questions to answer, each choice will lead to different insights and consequences. Will you outwit the AI or succumb to its scrutiny? Only your answers can decide.

Key Features:

Engaging AI Interaction: A series of deep and philosophical questions challenge your beliefs and push your self-awareness.

Dynamic Responses: Each answer you choose triggers unique reactions from the AI, affecting the story's direction.

Two Possible Endings: Depending on your choices, you may end up discovering that you’re not human or face a far more sinister outcome.

Achievements to Unlock: Hidden achievements await you as you uncover the true nature of the AI and its motives.
